Probably most unefficent and wrong way to solve a hard maths question.

## Question: 
In a school, every student has a student number starting from 00000 up to 99999. And student numbers of two radndom students have at least two different digits. How many students there are in this school?

What I understand is every scudent number will have 2 different digits from any other. For example, 00000 and 00011 is suitable. Because ones-digit and tens-digit are different. but 00000 and 00001 can't be. Because They have only ones-digit different. 

The markscheme says there are 10,000 students in school. 
I didn't understand how or why. So I made a program to check every number from 00000 to 99999.

It creates a text file called Q1Answers.txt (which is 47kb). First number in that file is how many students there are (6735 students) and the rest are students' numbers. Basicly I didn't find the answer markscheme has. 

If you find a way to solve this question the way it is supposed to and prove me wrong, please let me know.
